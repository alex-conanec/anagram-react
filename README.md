# Anagram test for developper

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the word anagram itself can be rearranged into nag a ram, also the word binary into brainy and the word adobe into abode.

With the small webpage coded in the react framework, modify the App.js file to correct the sentence and say if word1 and word2 are anagrams of each other.

A small bonus, add a bit of css to show yourself.

Good luck !!
